* Objects
** When to use Objects
   - First class modules are more expressive(A module can include
     types, while classes and objects cannot)
   - Modules, functors and data types also offer a wide range of ways
     to express program structure.
   - Objects vs Records
     - Objects don't require type definitions
     - Support for row polymorphism
     - Heavy syntax
     - Runtime cost
     - Objects can use the benefits of class system like inheritance
       and open recursion.
