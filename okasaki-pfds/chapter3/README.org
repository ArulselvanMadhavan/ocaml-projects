* Familiar Data Structures in a Functional setting
  - Leftist heaps
  - Binomial queues
  - Red Black trees

** Heaps
   - Efficient access to arbitrary elements(min, max)
   - Priority queue or heap
   - Heaps are often implemented as /heap-ordered/ trees.

** Leftist Heaps
   - Heap Ordered Binary trees
   - Rank of a left child is atleast as large as the rank of the right
     sibling.
   - Rank of a node: Length of its right spine.
   - Right spine is always the shortest path to an empty node.

** Binomial Heaps
   - /Binomial heaps/ or /Binomial queues/
   - Insert and merge can be made to run in O(1).
   - Binomial heaps are composed of primitive objects known as
     binomial trees.
   - Binomial tree of rank 0 is a singleton node.
   - Binomial tree of rank r + 1 is formed by linking two binomial
     trees of rank r, making one tree the leftmost child of the other.
   - ANother definition: Binomial tree of rank r is a node with r
     children (t1...tr), where each ti is a binomial tree of rank r - i.
   - BTree of rank r -> has exactly 2^r nodes.
   - Implementation of Binary Tree.
