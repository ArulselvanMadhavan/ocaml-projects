** BST
   - BST Invariant
     - For any node n, every node in the left subtree of n has a value
       less n's value and the right subtree has values greater than n.
   - Balanced Binary Tree structures - guarantees lookup of O(log n)
     - AVL trees
     - 2-3 trees
     - Red-black trees
   - RBT invariants
     - No two adjacent red nodes along any path.
     - Every path from the root to a leaf has the same number of black nodes.
       - Also known as the /Black height/ of the tree
     - Root of the tree is /Black/
