* Concurrent Programming with Async
** Approach(es) to concurrency
   - Use preemptive system threads
     - Requires significant memory and other resources per thread.
     - No control over scheduling of threads on CPU(OS interleaves are
       not deterministic)
   - Single-threaded program using event loop
